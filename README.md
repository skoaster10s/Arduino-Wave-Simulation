# Arduino Wave Simulation

This package contains:
- Python script that displays a real-time graph of the X-acceleration, X-velocity, and Z-rotation due to the way I wired the accelerometer and gyroscope
- Arduino sketch that outputs the X-, Y-, Z-accelerations and X-, Y-, Z-rotations in that order, each separated by a space
- Processing sketch that displays a real-time simulation of the waving of the Arduino (Currently being worked on)

Materials:
- Arduino Uno
- Acceleromter ([Adafruit MMA8451](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mma8451-accelerometer-breakout/overview) used here)
- Gyroscope ([Adafruit L3GD20H](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1032) used here)
- Breadboard (small would be ideal and easier to wave)
